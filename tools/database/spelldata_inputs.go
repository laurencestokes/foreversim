// The client rows sim/core/spelldata is built from, captured next to the generated store so that the
// store can be rebuilt - and checked - without the client database, which is gitignored and comes
// from a local WoW install.
//
// Raw client rows, copied as the loaders in spelldata_store.go read them:
//
//   - every SpellName row, whole. It is the universe the closure tests an edge against, so cutting it
//     to the store's own ids would make a spell that ought to be reached look like an id this build
//     does not name. The other tables are cut to the store's ids, which loses nothing: the closure
//     only ever reads the rows of a spell it has already reached.
//   - the talent tree's nodes, and the points each definition states.
//
// Derived, and captured all the same because re-deriving it needs tables the store does not otherwise
// read: the root ids. They come from the item, enchant and set-bonus tables, from the ladder and tree
// spells the class files are built from, and from the sibling-by-name rule, and they are captured
// wholesale - so a change to how a root is found shows up only once the store is regenerated.
//
// Everything else is left to be re-derived from the above: the closure, the hand links, the talent
// curves, the tooltip hints, the overrides and the rows themselves. That is what makes the
// regeneration a check on the generator rather than a copy of its answer. The hand-kept extra spells
// are added while rendering for the same reason - adding one without regenerating renders a row the
// committed store does not carry, and the check fails.

// Beside the client extraction rather than in it: assets/db_inputs/dbc is gitignored, being tens of
// megabytes rebuilt by `make db`, and this file has to be committed for the check to run without a
// database. Gzipped like the extraction's files, and named the same way, since it is read back the
// same way.
