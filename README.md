# WoW Forever Simulator

Welcome to the WoW Forever simulator! If you have questions or are thinking about contributing, [join our discord](https://discord.gg/jJMPr9JWwx) to chat!

The primary goal of this project is to provide a framework that makes it easy to build a DPS sim for any class/spec, with a polished UI and accurate results. Each community will have ownership / responsibility over their portion of the sim, to ensure accuracy and that their community is represented.

## Debug: weapon type override

Every equipped main-hand or off-hand weapon has a "Weapon type (debug override)" selector in its gear picker. Choosing a type (e.g. relabelling a sword as an axe) changes only what type the weapon counts as for effects that key off weapon type — racials like Human Sword Specialization, Orc Axe Specialization and Dwarf Mace Specialization, talents like rogue Hack and Slash, and ability requirements like rogue Backstab/Mutilate needing a dagger. The item's stats, procs and all other effects are completely unchanged. An overridden weapon shows a small "as &lt;type&gt;" badge in the gear list so the relabel is never mistaken for a real item. This exists purely to let you compare races/specs fairly on an otherwise-identical set of gear; it has no in-game equivalent and should not be used to represent an actual character.
