			<p className="m-0">
				The numbers come from the beta client&apos;s own data tables rather than BlizzCon tooltips, read against Classic Era and diffed spell by spell,
				and reviewed database updates bring in client builds from wago.tools. Talent values come from the client&apos;s rank curves, coefficients from{' '}
				<code>SpellEffect.EffectBonusCoefficient</code>, and each rank&apos;s damage is scaled to level 60 by the client&apos;s own per-level points.
			</p>
			<p className="m-0">Most of it is settled from data, a little of it has been seen happen, and it is worth being plain about which is which:</p>
			<ul className="m-0 flex flex-col gap-2 pl-5">
				<li>
					<strong>The client&apos;s tables, diffed against Classic Era.</strong> Most abilities carry the client&apos;s own numbers, and the rest are
					confirmed unchanged from Classic.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Hotfixes, which the static data does not carry.</strong> The live client&apos;s own hotfix cache is read instead, and reviewed
					database updates apply it.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Wording, not just values.</strong> A rank curve says what a talent&apos;s numbers are, not what they apply to, which is how Improved
					Seals passed a value check while scaling half of what it should.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Twelve abilities have been watched happen on a running server</strong> &mdash; through the client&apos;s own damage meter, on the
					beta &mdash; and every one landed where the client&apos;s tables said it would. A few more have been settled from the beta&apos;s public
					combat logs. So the honest reading is that the method works, not that the sim is verified: the rest are internally consistent and externally
					unconfirmed.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p className="m-0">
				<a href={`${SITE_BASE}evidence/`}>Every ability, and what is known about its numbers</a> &mdash; the whole list, filterable, with the reason
				attached to each row.
			</p>
		</Panel>
		<Panel summary="What it still cannot do">
			<p className="m-0">Every one of these can move a number, and some can move it a long way:</p>
			<ul className="m-0 flex flex-col gap-2 pl-5">
				<li>
					About twenty abilities still carry a number the client does not settle, most of them above the beta&apos;s level cap where nobody can check
					them yet. Each is named, with what would settle it, on the <a href={`${SITE_BASE}evidence/`}>evidence page</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The client stores what an ability does, not how the server runs it. Proc chances often read as unset, and rules like whether melee-table
					Holy damage partially resists are in no table.
				</li>
				<li>
					No healing sim runs, tank specs are measured on damage alone, and rotations are hand-written priority lists that nothing has re-tuned around
					the cooldowns Forever changed.
