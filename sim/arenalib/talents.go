// Searching the talent trees, because enumerating them is not a thing anyone can do.
//
// There are 89,776,730,783,606,094 builds a warrior could actually spend - counted by
// tools/talents/count_builds.py from the trees themselves, enforcing rank caps, row gates
// and the prerequisite arrows. Legality matters and does not rescue this: it cuts the count
// about fourfold from the same walk without the arrows, leaving two billion years at a
// second a build.
//
// Nor does restricting it to builds anyone would run. Count only the all-or-nothing ones,
// every talent maxed or untouched, which is roughly what an optimal build looks like, and a
// warrior still has 57,341,667 of them and a mage 1,261,940,421. Eighteen months and forty
// years respectively. "Try every configuration" is not a large job, it is an impossible one,
// and the honest response is not to run a subset and call it the answer.
//
// So: climb instead. Start from a build somebody already believed in, and repeatedly ask
// what one point is worth. Take the point whose removal costs least, give it to the talent
// whose addition gains most, and keep going while that trade is positive. It finds a local
// maximum rather than the global one, and the difference matters least exactly where people
// care most - near a build the community has already converged on.
//
// Two things keep it honest. The marginal pass is an approximation, because talents interact
// and measuring them one at a time cannot see that; so the combined move is measured for
// real before it is accepted, and rejected if the pair is worth less than the parts
// suggested. And every run shares a random seed, so two builds are compared over the same
// stream of rolls and the difference between them is signal rather than noise.
