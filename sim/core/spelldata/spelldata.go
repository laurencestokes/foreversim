// Package spelldata is the client's spell rows as the sim reads them: one Spell per spell ID, with
// its effects and power costs, and accessors that turn the client's units into core's.
//
// Values are stored in the units the client states them in - a percentage is the integer 16, rage is
// on a 0-1000 bar, times are milliseconds - and the conversion happens in the accessors, so a row
// always matches what the DBC says.
//
// Every accessor answers on the zero value, so Nil and NilEffect are safe to chain: an unknown spell
// reads as zeroes rather than crashing the registration that asked for it.
//
// sim/core must never import this package: tools/database imports core, and a cycle there would stop
// the generator that writes this package's data.
