// per shape. An empty answer means the rows state enough to build the listener the client describes.
//
// The one decision, for the generator that writes the registrations and for the sim that resolves
// them: both read this row, so a proc the generator emits is one the sim can build, and a proc it
// comments out is one nothing would have heard correctly.
//
// It differs from ProcTriggerUnsupported in who is wearing the item. A class's own spell states a
// class mask to narrow its listener to spells the caster really casts; an item is worn by every
// class, so a class mask on its trigger is the filter of the one class it was written for and names
// nothing the sim can reproduce. An item proc therefore has no character to weigh the mask against.
