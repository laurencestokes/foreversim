// What the generated half of the package has to provide. tools/database writes spells_auto_gen.go;
// nothing else in the package may assume it exists, so the store starts empty and answers Nil for
// every id until it is installed.
//
// spells_auto_gen.go declares:
//
//	var generatedSpells = []Spell{...}                  // every row, by strictly increasing ID
//	var generatedCurves = map[int32][][]float64{...}     // talent curve values, [effect position][rank - 1]
//	var generatedHandTriggers = map[int32][]int32{...}   // spells a server-side handler casts, by caster
//	func init() { install(generatedSpells, generatedCurves, generatedHandTriggers) }
//
// Calling install from the generated file's own init is what keeps the order right: package-level
// variables are initialised before any init runs, so the data is complete when install indexes it,
// and no file-name ordering is relied on.
//
// Two of the row's fields are named for the id they hold rather than for the accessor that resolves
// it, because a Go field and a method cannot share a name: Effect.TriggerID feeds Trigger(), and
// Spell.RefIDs feeds Refs(). The emitter writes those two names.
var spells = []Spell{}

// Talent curve values by spell id, as [effect position][rank - 1]. The effect is at the position
// EffectN counts by, not at the client's EffectIndex, which has gaps. A trait talent states one spell
// and its per-rank numbers live here rather than on ranks of their own.
